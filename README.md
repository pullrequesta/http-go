# http-go

http-go is my own implementation of `HTTP/1.1` server directly on top of Go’s standard `TCP` layer.
This library covers all essential parts of `HTTP/1.1` protocol, including parsing the request line and headers, according to [RFC 9110] and [RFC 9112]. It handles the message body, either `Content-Length` or transfer-chunked encoding behaviour. Furthermore, it implements the structured handling system to customize the respective response error type.
The library also supports proxy requests.

> [!WARNING]
> This is not a comprehensive library, e.g. it is not able to parse multi-line headers.

## Project Structure

## :sparkles: Features

### Supported Transport Potocols

- [x] TCP
- [x] UDP

### :books: RFC References

- [RFC 7231] – An active and widely referenced RFC.
- [RFC 9112] – Easier to read than RFC 7231, relies on understanding from RFC 9110.
- [RFC 9110] – Covers HTTP "semantics."
- [RFC 2616] – Deprecated by RFC 7231.

### :wrench: HTTP Stack Components

- Custom request parser using a state machine
- Support for request line, headers, CRLF parsing, and message bodies
- Custom response writer, including:
  - Status line
  - Headers
  - Body
  - Chunked body
- Chunked Transfer-Encoding writer:
  - Writes chunk size as a hexa decimal number
  - Writes data in the form of chunks
  - Writes terminating line
- Proxy Handler
  - Built-in proxy routing for paths like:
    - /httpbin/x → <https://httpbin.org/x>

### :rocket: Getting Started

1. Install Go

```zsh
Ensure Go ≥ 1.20 is installed.
```

2. Run the HTTP server

```zsh
go run cmd/httpserver/main.go
```

3. Make a request by using curl command

```zsh
curl -v localhost:42069
```

4. Raw HTTP over netcat (nc)

```zsh
echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 42069
```

5. Make a proxy request

```zsh
curl -v localhost:42069/httpbin/stream/10
```

### :outbox_tray: Example HTTP Response

A typical HTTP response looks like:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 13
 
Hello World!
```

A chunked HTTP response looks like:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
